# bt_motor_control
Controlling 4 motors using sabertooth motor controllers, 1 hobby servo, and 2 t200 through bluetooth
The only issue is the servo motors jerk around and don't stay at their written value when the PS3 controller is started up. 
it does not work, supposedly the timers are messed up but nothing I've tried so far has been able to fix it
